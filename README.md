## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master's thesis project, which focused on the development, control, and navigation of a tracked mobile robot. The project involved implementing various robotics concepts to enable autonomous operation.

## Hardware Components

### 1. Map Generation using `slam_toolbox`

This video demonstrates the robot's capability to generate a 2D map of an unknown environment using the `slam_toolbox` package in ROS. The robot navigates an indoor environment, mapping the space and identifying objects such as a monitor, a person, and other obstacles. The robot's movement and image recognition are displayed in real-time, showcasing its ability to perceive and understand its surroundings.

### 4. Image Recognition with YOLO

The robot is also equipped with image recognition capabilities using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. This allows the robot to detect and classify objects in its environment.

*(You can add a photo or a more detailed description of the image recognition implementation here.)*

You can copy and paste the content above into a new file named `README.md` in your GitHub repository. You'll need to fill in the details for the "Hardware Components" section and add the photo for the "Image Recognition with YOLO" section as you planned.
